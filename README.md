# Password Generator

This Python script generates a random password based on user preferences, including the desired length, and whether to include numbers and special characters.

## Features

- Customizable password length.
- Option to include numbers.
- Option to include special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`).

## Usage

1. **Run the script**.
2. You will be prompted to provide:
   - **Minimum password length** (an integer).
   - Whether to include **numbers** (input `y` for yes or `n` for no).
   - Whether to include **special characters** (input `y` for yes or `n` for no).
3. The script will generate and display a password meeting the specified criteria.

### Example

```bash
enter the minimum length: 10
do you want to have numbers (y/n)? y
do you want to have special character  (y/n)? y
THE PASSWORD GENERATED IS: q8U&l*P5n@
```

## Code Overview

The script defines a function `generator_password()` that accepts the following parameters:
- `min_length` (int): The minimum required length of the password.
- `numbers` (boolean): Whether to include numbers in the password.
- `special_characters` (boolean): Whether to include special characters.

The function generates a password that meets the criteria by randomly selecting characters until all specified conditions are fulfilled.

## Dependencies

This script uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules. No external libraries are required.

## How to Run

To run the script:
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Copy the script to a `.py` file (e.g., `password_generator.py`).
3. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```
